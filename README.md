# HTML / CSS website project

Hello,

I only recently started my coding journey and I have been trying my hand at helping people with HTML & CSS via Codebar in Edinburgh (which is set up by very nice and awesome people https://codebar.io/edinburgh).

Throughout these sessions we go through a lot of the basics of building a simple webpage, creating headers, titles, paragraphs, looking at colors, fonts..etc and I have been asked a lot of questions about building a very simple website / page / thing... so I am currently trying my hand at building a websitepagething using only HTML & CSS to help answer some of these questions.

This is a work in progress. Expect updates, changes of all sorts and possibly general ramblings of all sorts.
